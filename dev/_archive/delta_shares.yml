# 1. Metastore Admins have the right to create and manage shares, providers and recipients
# 2. Any group/user added to the metastore_admins group will have the capability
# 3. In order to provision deltasharing in an automated way, the service account (running the terraform deployment)
#  must have the following privileges:
#    a. Create Recipient
#    b. Create Share
#    c. Use Recipient
#    d. Use Share
#    e. Create Provider
#    f. Use Provider
#    g. Set Share Permission
# 4. Regular users do not have any permission on the metastore, which means they wont see Recipients, Providers or Shares
# 5. platform_admins will have elevated privileges
# 6. In order to share data manually, i.e. not using Terraform, any user or group
#    a. USE RECIPEINT : This allows a provider user who is not a metastore admin to view recipient details,
#    recipient authentication status, and the list of shares that the provider has shared with the recipient.
#    b. USE SHARE:  gives a provider user read-only access to all shares defined in a provider metastore.
#    This allows a provider user who is not a metastore admin to list shares and list the assets (tables and notebooks)
#    in a share, along with the share's recipients.
#    c. USE PROVIDER:  gives a recipient user read-only access to all providers in a recipient metastore and their shares.
#    Combined with the CREATE CATALOG privilege, this privilege allows a recipient user who is not a metastore admin
#    to mount a share as a catalog.


# How do we restrict users from creating share, and sharing data on existing shares
# who will be able to create the recipient as a one time?
# who will be able to add objects to the created delta share
